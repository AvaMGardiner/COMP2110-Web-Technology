# COMP2110: Web-Technology

**Overview**

In this unit, I delved into a variety of techniques and concepts pertinent to the implementation of systems on the World Wide Web. I started with the development of websites using HTML and CSS, mastering the art of creating visually appealing and functional web pages. 

As I progressed, I ventured into the realm of complete client-server applications, understanding the intricate dynamics of request-response communication in the web environment. This unit offered a comprehensive exploration of web technology, shedding light on the standards that form the backbone of the web.

I also gained insights into the programming techniques employed to leverage these standards in the creation of robust web applications. The knowledge I acquired in this unit was vast and diverse, spanning the full spectrum of web technology. It was a journey of discovery and learning, equipping me with the skills necessary to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of the World Wide Web.

**Technology Used**

In this project, I utilised several tools and software. I wrote my code using [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download), a powerful and versatile code editor. To ensure compatibility and responsiveness across different platforms, I tested my web pages on various web browsers. These included [**Firefox**](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/), [**Internet Explorer**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/download/internet-explorer.aspx), [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/), and [**Opera**](https://www.opera.com/download). All of this software was run on my Windows operating system.

Later in the unit, I was introduced to [**Strapi**](https://strapi.io/), a more robust server-side package. Strapi implements a backend JSON server, which I used to serve data to a front-end Javascript application. This tool significantly enhanced the functionality and efficiency of my web development process. Overall, the combination of these tools provided a comprehensive environment for web development, allowing me to effectively build and test my web applications.

**Web Design**

In my web design assignment, I created a CSS stylesheet for a sample webpage. The distinctive feature of this task was the peer-review process. I had the chance to evaluate and provide feedback on my classmates' work, and they did the same for mine. The final grade was determined by the peer evaluations. This assignment not only honed my technical skills but also developed my critical analysis and feedback abilities. It was an enriching experience that broadened my knowledge of web design and the peer review process.

**Web Application**

In my web development assignment, I was tasked with building a job listing web application, similar to platforms like Seek or Glassdoor. The application was engineered to showcase a list of available jobs, incorporate a search feature for users to locate specific jobs, enable users to delve into job details, and subsequently apply for a job. The project required the use of a data store and had to meet a set of functional requirements. I was also provided with tests that my code needed to pass to ensure its functionality and reliability. This assignment was both challenging and rewarding, pushing me to apply my web development skills in a real-world context.
