# Web Design Assignment

This semester we'll be writing a web application that implements a jobs board.  Bob's Jobs will allow you to search for jobs, upload your CV and and even apply for jobs online.  We'll get to the web application development later, but the first task is to design the  page layout of this application.

This project contains a sample page in HTML, it contains various elements that might be common for a front page like this - navigation, header, listings of jobs, company reviews etc.

Your task is to complete the CSS stylesheet (`static/style.css`) to be included from this page to make the page look as good as possible.  You are **not allowed to change the HTML code**. You may only write CSS rules to reference what is already in the page to change the layout and display properties. In this respect, this exercise is similar to the [CSS Zen Garden](https://csszengarden.com/) discussed in the 'CSS Zen Garden' video.

The HTML page you are provided with contains many elements, classes and ids that can be used in your CSS stylesheet rules.  There are standard elements such as navigation lists and header blocks that you will find are similar to those used in many CSS tutorials including the ones from the lecture material in this unit.  

You can use any browser you want to test your design but it should be a modern one such as Chrome or Firefox.  It pays to test your design in alternate browsers and with different browser window widths. A common error is to design for a very wide monitor - this can mean that when someone views your page on a laptop screen the design would not work.  Test your design at different browser window sizes to check that it works ok.

## Github Classroom

The starter kit for this assignment is available when you accept the assignment on Github Classroom. Click on [**this link to accept the assignment**](https://classroom.github.com/assignment-invitations/ff177d94a234328d5367b30371516a47/status) to accept the assignment. This will create a copy of the assignment repository for you with the starter files. Complete your work in that repository and commit your changes often. Push frequently to Github to ensure you don't lose any work.

## Submission

You will not submit the assignment explicitly; we will look at the contents of your Github repository after the due date of **5pm, Sunday 20th March**. We will be able to see from that the last modification date of your files. Do not change your repository after the due date unless you have an extension (special consideration).

**Do NOT rename index.html and style.css**. Remember to put your name and student ID (at least) in the comment on the top of your stylesheet. This is your work, your IP, acknowledge it!

## Marking

This assignment will be peer-marked - that is, you will get a chance to rate the work of a number of (i.e., up to 20) other students. The marking criteria are as follows:
- **Overall design**: your page design works and provides a clear layout of the information on the page and navigation elements
- **Originality and Creativity**: your design shows some creativity
- **Use of CSS**: you've made good use of CSS technology to achieve your design
  
You will rate each submission on these three criteria and your ratings will go towards the grades of the other students. Note that unit staff will also review the submissions and may override the peer-assessment mark if appropriate. More detailed information on peer-marking will be released after the due of the Web Design assignment.
